# RSNet-for-estimating-the-backscatter-from-dry-soil-surface-under-large-roughness-conditions

This is a light module for predicting the backscattering coefficients at L- and S-bands for dry soil surfaces under large roughness conditions. 

# Dependencies
This tutorial depends on the following libraries:
1. python == 3.6.13
2. tensorflow
3. Keras >= 1.1

# About Keras
Keras is a minimalist, highly modular neural networks library, written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.
